PURPOSE  
———  
The Beaded Sanctuary Module creates a soft interior landscape inside any MythWear
garment. It offers grounding, calm, and a sense of shelter through interior beads
placed along the rim, crown arc, or spine-line of a hood or garment.

This module may be paired with:  
- MythWear Hood  
- RootMask side panels  
- Leaf Circuit spine lines  
- Wrist–Elbow bands (rare, symbolic)  
- Tabi ankle bands (micro-sanctuary node)

MATERIALS  
————  
• 12–40 small wooden beads (¾–1¼ inches)  
• Natural cord (cotton, hemp, waxed linen, soft leather)  
• Thin muslin or jersey fabric for tunnels  
• Optional: a single drop of cedar or sandalwood oil for personal garments

PLACEMENT OPTIONS  
———————  
Choose one or more:

1. **Rim Bead Circuit**  
   A soft row of beads along the interior rim of a hood — creates a threshold,
   a quiet “doorway” into breath.

2. **Crown Arc Path**  
   Beads from temple → crown → temple.  
   Provides gentle micro-pressure during grounding.

3. **Spine-Line Sanctuary**  
   Beads inside or alongside a spine cord channel on any garment.

4. **Side Sanctuary (RootMask variation)**  
   Beads added along temple-side ribs for quiet sensory feedback.

INSTALLATION  
———————  
1. Sew a narrow tunnel where beads will live.  
2. Thread beads onto a cord and feed through the tunnel.  
3. Tie off securely; optionally add a small hidden opening.  
4. Space beads to prevent clacking; aim for quiet tactile sound.  
5. Ensure smooth surfaces and safe stitching (especially for children).

SAFETY NOTES  
————————  
• Avoid heavy beads or pressure points.  
• No scented oils for shared/classroom garments.  
• Inspect regularly for loose stitching.  

EXPERIENCE  
—————  
The wearer should feel a gentle cave-like shelter — a portable sanctuary.  
A quiet place to breathe without leaving the room.  
A way to signal need without words.

PHILOSOPHY  
—————  
This module carries forward the idea that clothing can teach, shelter, and
restore. It is a soft refuge in motion — a cave that travels with the wearer.
