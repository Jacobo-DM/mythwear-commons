Purpose
———
The Leaf Circuit is a stitched or corded pattern worn on the body — a quiet
“map of flow” that helps the wearer sense attention, movement, and emotional
state. Inspired by leaf veins, tree branches, and river deltas, it functions
as a wearable nervous system.

It teaches:
- flow awareness,
- grounding,
- direction of force (RageDance),
- and returning the mind to the body.

Design Principles
———————
- A central “spine line” acts as the main trunk.
- Branches extend outward in gentle arcs.
- Every line invites awareness of motion.
- Nothing constrictive; everything flexible.

Locations
————
Leaf Circuits can be placed on:

- torso (front or back)
- upper back + shoulder blades
- arms (upper arm → forearm pathway)
- legs (hip → knee or knee → ankle)
- hoods (paired with the spine line)
- wrists or ankles (paired with bands)

For MythWear, the most common placements are:
1. **Upper back**
2. **Torso (front or back)**
3. **Arms**

Materials
————
- Thin cotton tape
- Braided cord
- Embroidery floss (thick)
- Leather lacing (soft, flat)
- Yarn (tight twist)
- Fabric paint (matte, textured)

Colors should be earthy or neutral for calm, or bright if symbolic.

Basic Pattern Structure
————————
1. Start with a **spine line**:
   - From top of the hood or collar
   - Down the center of the garment
   - Optionally continuing toward the tailbone

2. Add **primary branches**:
   - Curve from the spine line outward
   - Toward shoulder, ribs, or hips
   - 2–4 per side

3. Add **secondary branches**:
   - Shorter offshoots from the primary ones
   - Keep them gentle, flowing, and organic

4. Optional: **leaf nodes** at the end of each branch:
   - stitched leaf shapes
   - bead accents
   - small patches in leaf form

Stitching Options
———————
1. **Couching**  
   Lay cord on fabric, tack down with small stitches.

2. **Backstitch or splitstitch**  
   For embroidery-style circuits.

3. **Fabric paint**  
   For a clean, graphic look (child-friendly).

4. **Appliqué**  
   Cut small leaf shapes and stitch them at line ends.

Placement Examples
———————
Upper Back Version:
- Spine line from collar → mid-back
- Two large branches toward each shoulder blade
- Two downward branches toward lower ribs

Arm Version:
- Spine line on outer arm
- Branches toward tricep and forearm
- Optional leaf node at wrist

Torso Version (Front):
- Spine line from sternum → navel
- Branches toward ribs and hips

Intended Use
—————
- RageDance training (direction of force)
- Mindfulness and somatic grounding
- Classroom calm and focus
- Emotional regulation and self-returning
- Movement, stretching, and breathwork
- Artistic expression on garments

How It Works Somatically
—————————
Each branch is a “pathway” for attention:

- When the wearer moves, they can feel or visualize the path.
- When frustrated, they can “trace the leaf” to return inward.
- When overwhelmed, they can follow the spine line to ground themselves.

It is a visual + tactile nervous system that teaches:

- presence,
- flow,
- direction,
- and calm.

Variations
————
- Mirror-image circuits for symmetry
- Asymmetrical circuits for storytelling
- Paired with wrist bands for a complete force path
- Paired with hood spine line
- Glow-thread or reflective paint for night movement

Philosophy
—————
The Leaf Circuit is the map of returning — a way of making the inner world
visible on cloth. It is not ornament alone. It is a quiet teacher: a pattern
that invites the wearer back into themselves in moments when they most need it.
