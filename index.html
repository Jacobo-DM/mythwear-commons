    <h1>🌿 MythWear Commons</h1>
    <p><strong>Wearable movement medicine for the Commons.</strong></p>

    <p>
      MythWear Commons is an open, evolving collection of patterns, guides, and
      story-rooted designs that explore clothing as a form of sanctuary —
      something that supports movement, grounding, warmth, and presence.
    </p>

    <p>
      MythWear is part of the broader <em>Flower Road</em> ecosystem, where
      movement, somatics, story, and open hardware meet. Every pattern here is
      offered as a seed: adaptable, remixable, and shaped by the people who wear it.
    </p>

    <h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Movement-responsive garments (hoods, wraps, bands, layers)</li>
      <li>Open patterns and low-cost, community-buildable designs</li>
      <li>Textiles designed for warmth, grounding, and sensory comfort</li>
      <li>Guides and teacher notes for use in learning and community spaces</li>
      <li>Mythic and cultural story threads carried with care</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Ethos</h2>
    <p>
      MythWear is not about optimization or performance.
      It is about <strong>regulation, agency, and return</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people — especially children and neuroemergent individuals —
      experience sound, temperature, and movement more intensely.
      The designs here explore how softness, layering, and gentle containment
      can help the nervous system stay regulated in noisy or unpredictable environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not armor. It is not isolation.
      It is clothing that makes care easier to feel.
    </p>

    <h2>Commons, Not a Brand</h2>
    <p>
      MythWear is a Commons. Designs are shared so they can be adapted,
      improved, and carried forward by many hands.
