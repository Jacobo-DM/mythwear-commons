Purpose
———
The RootMask (or RootFace) is a soft, breathable face structure inspired by
the ribs of cactus paddles — filtering light and presence without blocking
breath or sight. Its purpose is quiet protection, sensory modulation, and
a feeling of belonging inside the natural world.

The mask should feel like stepping into a shaded grove or a cactus hollow:
ventilated, alive, porous, and calm.

Design Principles
———————
- Breath-first design: nothing restricts airflow.
- Sight remains open; the mask shapes light but does not block vision.
- Structure echoes desert cactus ribs: vertical + diagonal lattice.
- Zero pressure on bridge of nose; zero pressure on jaw hinge.
- Light, soft, and symbolic rather than medical.

Basic Shape
————
1. Begin with a simple cloth mask shape (triangular or gently curved).
2. Remove the traditional “front panel” — replace it with open lattice strips.
3. The structure consists of:
   - 2–3 vertical “ribs” running from cheek to cheek.
   - 4–6 diagonal or arched ribs connecting across the face.
4. The lattice frame may widen toward the bottom to create space for breath.

Materials
————
- Soft cotton tape (¼–½ inch width).
- Bias tape, jersey strips, or narrow linen bands.
- Optional: thin bamboo or rattan strips for a firmer frame.
- Optional: stitching thread in natural greens, browns, or earth tones.

Construction
———————
1. Cut your ribs:
   - 2–3 vertical.
   - Several shorter diagonals.
2. Lay them on a table in the shape of a nopal (cactus paddle):
   - Thickest part at center.
   - Thinner edges toward sides.
3. Stitch each intersection securely, forming a soft grid.
4. Add soft loops or straps at the temples to hold the mask lightly in place.
5. Optional:
   - Add a thin reinforcement band across the cheek line.
   - Add a brow-line curve for comfort and stability.

Sensation
————
The RootMask should feel:
- Light as leaves overhead,
- Soft on the skin,
- Breathable from every angle,
- And grounding without hiding the wearer’s face.

Intended Use
—————
- Grounding in classrooms and open spaces.
- Movement practice: RageDance, walking, stretching, breathwork.
- Moments of overstimulation (visual or emotional).
- Symbolic anchoring: feeling “in the grove,” “in the cactus,” or “in the desert.”

Safety Notes
—————
- Not meant to filter particles or function as PPE.
- Should never restrict breathing.
- Ensure all edges are soft and smooth.
- Avoid elastic that pulls tightly on the ears.

Variations
————
- Add two small temple loops for beads or bells.
- Create a double-layer grid for more visual shading.
- Add a chin-line band for stability during movement sessions.
- Stitch decorative leaf-shaped or rib-shaped appliqués.

Philosophy
—————
The RootMask is an architectural form for the face — a reminder of desert
plants that breathe, endure, and protect through openness rather than walls.
It is a soft sign of belonging: a mask that reveals more than it hides,
teaching presence, breath, and gentle resilience.
