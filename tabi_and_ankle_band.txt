Purpose
———
The Tabi + Ankle Band set is designed for grounding, quiet stepping, balance,
and somatic listening. This pattern creates:
- split-toe tabi (“listening shoes”), and
- a soft Achilles band that trains the line from heel → ankle → knee → spine.

This set supports RageDance, mindful walking, sensory grounding in classrooms,
and silent movement practices.

Design Principles
———————
- The split toe increases balance and sensory input.
- Soles remain thin enough to feel the earth or floor beneath the wearer.
- The ankle band provides subtle support without constriction.
- Every part of the design encourages quiet movement.

Materials
————
Tabi:
- Soft cotton canvas, linen, denim, or lightweight neoprene.
- Optional thin rubber or cork sole for outdoor use.
- Soft elastic or Velcro for closure.

Ankle Band:
- Cotton tape or soft elastic (4–6 cm / 1.5–2.5 inches wide).
- Optional interior padding.
- Optional bead or knot node at the Achilles line.

Sizing
————
Tabi sizing should match bare foot length with:
- 0.5–1 cm extra at toe,
- split-toe division reinforced like a soft glove.

The ankle band should:
- wrap around the Achilles region,
- sit comfortably without sliding,
- avoid pressure on the ankle bones.

Tabi Construction
————————
1. **Trace the Foot**
   - Draw the outline of the foot on paper.
   - Mark the split between the big toe and second toe.

2. **Cut Fabric**
   - Cut two mirrored pieces for each foot (inner + outer layer).
   - Add 1 cm seam allowance.

3. **Sew the Toes**
   - Stitch the split-toe divider first.
   - Reinforce this seam — it takes the most tension.

4. **Assemble the Upper**
   - Stitch inner and outer layers together.
   - Add closure at the heel or side (Velcro, ties, or elastic).

5. **Add the Sole (optional)**
   - For indoor use: fabric only.
   - For outdoor: add thin rubber, cork, or leather.

6. **Finish Edges**
   - Add bias tape or clean folds around ankle opening.

Ankle Band Construction
—————————
1. Cut a strip of cotton tape or soft elastic long enough to wrap the ankle comfortably.
2. Stitch ends together into a loop.
3. Optional: sew a bead or knot node at the BACK of the band, aligned with the Achilles tendon.
4. Add a soft interior lining if needed.

Fit and Feel
—————
The tabi should feel:
- quiet,
- light,
- flexible,
- connected to the ground.

The ankle band should feel:
- supportive but gentle,
- never tight,
- like a guiding hand at the back of the ankle.

Somatic Function
————————
The split toe:
- increases sensory input,
- improves balance,
- encourages quiet stepping.

The ankle band:
- aligns heel → ankle → knee → spine,
- helps the wearer walk silently,
- improves grounding,
- supports transition from freeze/anxiety states to movement.

Practice Uses
—————
- RageDance grounding sequences
- Martial arts stepping patterns
- Mindful walking
- Writing breaks and classroom calm
- Balance practice for students
- Evening reflection walks
- Soft terrain hiking (indoor tabi or outdoor versions)

Variations
—————
- Add leaf nodes to top of foot
- Full sock-style tabi
- Tabi boots with extended ankle height
- Double ankle band (Achilles + lower calf)
- Glow-thread seams for night movement

Safety Notes
—————
- Avoid making the ankle band too tight; circulation must remain free.
- Reinforce tabi seams if practicing vigorous movement.
- Outdoor soles should be thin enough for feeling, thick enough for safety.

Philosophy
—————
Tabi and the ankle band remind us that grounding begins in the feet:
the first listeners, the quiet teachers of balance, presence, and return.
When the feet listen, the whole body hears.
