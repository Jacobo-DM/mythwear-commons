    <h1>About MythWear Commons</h1>

    <p>
      MythWear began as a simple question:<br />
      <em>How can tools, garments, and objects help people move, feel, and imagine more freely?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      It grew into an open-hardware, open-story project dedicated to healing, movement, and creative agency.
      MythWear is not a brand — it is a <strong>Commons</strong>:
      a shared field where designs, symbols, and prototypes travel freely and belong to many.
    </p>

    <h2>Roots</h2>
    <p>
      MythWear is shaped by the Flower Road, Rage Dance, somatic practice, simple tools,
      and the belief that people learn best when the body is awake and the imagination is invited.
    </p>

    <h2>What Lives Here</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>open designs for garments, tools, and movement aids,</li>
      <li>the MythWear Commons License,</li>
      <li>the Flower Road &amp; Discovery Mode Declaration,</li>
      <li>stories, diagrams, and field prototypes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why It Is Open</h2>
    <p>
      Because healing does not want gates.<br />
      Because movement does not want permissions.<br />
      Because creativity thrives when no one owns the horizon.
    </p>

    <p>
      All MythWear work remains part of the Commons, guided by care, responsibility,
      and the soft ethics of the Flower Road.
