# 🌿 MythWear Commons  
**Wearable movement medicine for the Commons.**  
An open, steadily evolving collection of patterns, circuits, and story-rooted designs that help people feel more alive — and more at ease — in their bodies.

MythWear is part of the Flower Road ecosystem — a space where movement, somatics, and story meet open hardware. Every pattern here is offered as a seed: adaptable, remixable, and shaped by the people who wear it.

## ✨ What Is MythWear?
MythWear explores:
- **movement-responsive clothing** (hoods, wraps, belts, braids)  
- **open hardware patterns** (Leaf Circuit, Mudhead Band, StarBone Conductor)  
- **low-cost, community-buildable prototypes**  
- **textiles as sanctuary** — warmth, grounding, presence  
- **sensory comfort and nervous-system support**, especially for noise- and stimulus-sensitive wearers  
- **mythic and cultural motifs**, carried with care  

This is not a brand.  
It is a **Commons** — a shared creative space for anyone who wishes to build tools that help humans breathe easier, move freely, and return to themselves.

## 📂 Structure
- `/patterns` — sewing & construction patterns (PDF/SVG/JPEG/Markdown)  
- `/prototypes` — early-stage concepts, material lists, revisions  
- `/mythology` — the story threads that shape the designs  
- `/open-hardware` — circuits, sensors, and low-cost modules  
- `/docs` — how-to guides, build notes, and photo walk-throughs  
- `/guides` — teacher notes, care notes, and sensory-comfort design guidance

## 🧵 Philosophy
MythWear is built around three commitments:

1. **Movement First**  
   Clothing should amplify freedom and embodiment, not restrict it.

2. **Commons Over Commodity**  
   Designs are shared, remixable, and collectively improved.

3. **Myth Matters**  
   Every pattern carries a story. Every stitch is a way of remembering.

A fourth principle is implicit throughout the work:  
**Softness is a form of intelligence.**  
Comfort, layering, and gentle containment can help people — especially children and neuroemergent individuals — remain regulated in loud or unpredictable environments.

You may adapt, remix, and teach from this work, but not in ways that exploit people or harm the Commons.

## 🌱 Invitation
If you build something from these patterns — even a tiny prototype — consider adding your notes, variations, and discoveries. The Commons grows because people like you add light to it.

This project values care, clarity, and contribution over scale.

**More coming soon.**
