# RootMask / RootFace · Nopal Lattice  
Commons Blueprint v1.0

## Purpose
A lightweight mask inspired by the inner skeleton of a nopal cactus.  
Warm, breathable, protective without restricting vision.

## Materials
- Felt, cotton, linen, or soft leather scraps
- Thin reed or cord for the lattice
- Optional inner shade layer
- Scissors, needle, thread

## Pattern Steps
1. Cut a soft oval mask shape from mid-forehead to mid-cheek.
2. Leave a wide, comfortable eye opening.
3. Trace “nopal roots” outward from the center between the brows.
4. Stitch thin cords along these branching lines.
5. Add small vents for breath and warmth.
6. Attach soft straps at the temples.

## Notes
- Should feel like “being inside a plant.”
- No pressure points.
- Perfect for Mudhead play and quiet sensory time.
