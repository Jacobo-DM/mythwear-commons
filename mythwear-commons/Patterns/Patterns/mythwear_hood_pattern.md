# MythWear Hood · Arc–Spine Pattern  
Commons Blueprint v1.0

## Purpose
A soft, structured hood that creates a grounding arc from the forehead to the tailbone.  
Designed for movement medicine, sensory regulation, and gentle warmth.  
Inspired by plant chambers that warm, shield, and breathe.

## Materials
- Soft cotton, hemp, jersey, or fleece (reclaimed preferred)
- Optional inner layer for warmth or weighted grounding
- Braided forehead band or soft jute-style cord
- Three anchor loops (center, left temple, right temple)
- Long spine cord running down the hood seam
- Needle, thread, scissors

## Pattern Steps
1. Cut two mirrored hood panels shaped like elongated raindrops.
2. Sew together along the curved back seam.
3. Attach a braided forehead band; add three loops:
   - **Center loop** on the midline.
   - **Temple loops** above the brows.
4. Attach a spine cord from the center loop, following the top seam down the back.
5. Finish face opening with a soft hem.

## Notes
- Should feel like entering a warm, quiet plant chamber.
- Should not compress the head.
- Loops allow children to add bells, beads, charms, scents.

## Use
Movement practice, quiet grounding, sensory regulation, story play.
