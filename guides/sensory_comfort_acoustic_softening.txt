This design note addresses sensory sensitivity to sound, especially for neuroemergent individuals and children.

Many people experience sound more intensely than others. Sudden, sharp, or unpredictable noise can overwhelm the nervous system and cause distress, even when no harm is intended.

The goal of this garment is not to block sound or isolate the wearer from the world. It is to soften acoustic impact and provide a sense of comfort and containment that supports nervous-system regulation.

Design principles:
- Attenuation rather than silence
- Softness rather than pressure
- Layering rather than hard barriers
- Comfort that supports human connection

Materials such as compressed wool felt, layered natural fibers, and soft hood geometry can reduce the sharpness and intensity of sound without sealing the ears or trapping heat.

This work is inspired by everyday moments: children startled by street noise, caregivers offering comfort, and the quiet effectiveness of softness and presence.

The garment is intended as a sensory buffer — not protection, not armor, and not a substitute for care — but a support for it.
