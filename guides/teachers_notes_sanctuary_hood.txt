MythWear Hood · Arc–Spine Pattern v1.1

Purpose
———
A soft hood that frames the face, tracks the spine, and offers three anchor points
for bells, braids, beads, or cords. It should feel protective and warm without
blocking peripheral vision or tightening around the throat.

Key Ideas
———––
- Three-point balance at the brow and temples.
- A “spine line” that runs over the crown and down the back.
- Nothing tight around the throat; breath and rotation stay free.
- Optional: interior bead lining for sanctuary and grounding (see Beaded Sanctuary Module).

Basic Shape
————
1. Start from a simple hoodie hood pattern that fits loosely.
2. Extend the front edge so it can form a soft frame around the face.
3. Add extra width at the neck so the hood can drape rather than pull.
4. The finished hood should feel like a portable cave: protective, but not heavy.

Three Anchor Points
———————
1. Center Point (Brow)
   - Located at the midpoint above the eyebrows.
   - Reinforce a 2–3 cm segment with a small patch of fabric on the inside.
   - Add a discreet loop or buttonhole for attaching braids, beads, or bells.

2. Left Temple Point
   - 3–4 cm behind and slightly above the outer corner of the left eye.
   - Reinforce as above and add a loop, ring, or stitched eyelet.

3. Right Temple Point
   - Mirror the left temple point on the right side.

These three points form a triangle of balance: center + left + right. They are
attachment points for adornment, sensory tools, or symbolic markers.

Spine Line
———–––
1. Mark a line from the center brow point, over the crown, and down the back of the hood.
2. On the inside of the hood, sew a narrow channel (about 1.5–2 cm wide) along this line.
3. A soft cord, braid, or flat tape can be threaded through this channel.
4. The cord may:
   - End at the base of the skull, or
   - Continue into the collar or cape if the garment has one.

The spine line is both a visible design feature and a felt axis: a reminder of posture,
orientation, and the “line of return” down the back.

Suggested Materials
———————
- Outer: medium-weight cotton, linen, twill, or soft wool.
- Inner: smooth, skin-friendly lining (cotton, bamboo, or similar).
- Loops: cotton tape, braided yarn, or soft webbing.
- Spine cord: flat cotton tape, braided cord, or soft leather.
- Optional (for beads): small wooden beads with smooth finish.

Fitting Notes
—————
- The hood should clear the forehead comfortably without pressing on the eyes.
- When the wearer turns their head side to side, the hood should move with them,
  not twist or choke at the neck.
- The front opening should allow full peripheral vision.
- For children, ensure:
  - No drawstrings that can catch or tangle.
  - No points of pressure at the throat.
  - They can pull the hood off quickly and independently.

Adaptations
————
- Extra loops along the spine line for more bells, beads, or charms.
- Side ties to create a partial veil when the wearer needs more privacy.
- Small “thumb pockets” or tabs near the front edge so a wearer can pull the hood down
  and feel anchored.
- Light quilting or double layers in cold climates; single layer in warm ones.

Intended Use
—————
This hood is a gentle shell for movement practice, grounding, quiet play, walking,
writing, resting, or simply feeling safe enough to move. There is no single “correct”
way to wear it, as long as breath and safety come first.

It pairs well with RageDance, reading, journaling, and classroom calm.

OPTIONAL MODULE: BEADED SANCTUARY LINING
(Portable Cave · Traveling Sanctuary · Inner Grove)
--------------------------------------------------

Purpose
———
To create a soft interior landscape — a quiet, grounding “cave” the wearer carries
with them. The beads give micro-pressure, gentle sound, and a sense of shelter.

Materials
———––
- 12–40 small wooden beads (approx. ¾–1¼ inch).
- Natural cord (cotton, hemp, waxed linen) or soft leather thong.
- Thin muslin, jersey, or soft lining cloth to form a bead tunnel.
- Optional: one tiny touch of cedar or sandalwood oil on the beads
  (only for personally owned hoods, never shared ones).

Placement Options
———————
Choose one or more:

1. Rim Bead Circuit
   - Sew a narrow “tunnel” just inside the front edge of the hood.
   - Insert beads on a cord so they rest gently against the forehead and sides
     when the hood is drawn forward.
   - This creates a threshold feeling: crossing into a quieter space.

2. Crown Arc Path
   - Place beads in a tunnel that runs from left temple → over the top of the head
     → to right temple.
   - The beads offer rhythmic micro-pressure on the head, helpful for grounding
     or post-RageDance cooldown.

3. Spine-Line Sanctuary
   - Use the existing spine channel or add a parallel tunnel down the back of the hood.
   - Insert a string of beads that gently greet the upper spine when the wearer leans back.

Installation
—————
1. Sew a narrow fabric tunnel where the beads will live (rim, crown arc, or spine line).
2. Thread the beads onto a cord and feed the cord through the tunnel.
3. Tie off both ends securely so beads cannot escape.
4. For removable beads, include a small hidden opening with a button or tie.
5. Space beads so they do not clack loudly — the sound should be quiet, intimate,
   or nearly silent.

Safety Notes
—————
- Avoid heavy beads; keep the weight soft and comfortable.
- Ensure there are no sharp edges; beads should be smooth to the touch.
- For shared/classroom hoods, avoid scented oils (allergies, sensitivities).
- Check stitching regularly so no bead or cord can pull loose.

Experience
————
When worn:

- Drawing the hood down becomes a small ritual: an invitation to pause.
- The beads offer tactile feedback for fingers, forehead, or upper spine.
- The hood feels like a portable sanctuary, a cave the wearer can enter and exit
  without leaving the room.

TEACHER’S NOTES · CLASSROOM USE (Optional)
-----------------------------------------

What this module offers
—————————
The Beaded Sanctuary Hood gives students a nonverbal way to say:

- “I’m overwhelmed.”
- “I need a breath.”
- “I need a moment, but I am still here.”

Instead of leaving the room or calling attention to themselves, a student can quietly:

- draw the hood forward,
- feel the beads at the rim, crown, or spine,
- and take 15–60 seconds to regulate.

The hood is not a costume or a punishment; it is a shared tool for calm.

Classroom Guidelines (suggested)
————————————
You might introduce it with language like:

- “This hood is here to help anyone who feels overwhelmed or needs a moment to reset.”
- “If you need a breath, you can pull the hood forward for a little while, but please stay
   present and with us.”
- “The hood is for calm, not for hiding. You are still part of the room.”

Benefits
———
- Supports self-regulation and emotional recovery.
- Helps students return to task after frustration or sensory overload.
- Reduces disruptions because students can care for themselves quietly.
- Works well for neurodivergent students, anxious students, English learners,
  and anyone who needs a small, portable refuge.

Equity and Inclusion
————————
The hood should not be a “special needs object” reserved for one or two students.
Any student may use it, just as anyone might use:

- a fidget stone,
- a quiet corner,
- or breathing exercises.

In this way, the hood models:
- shared tools,
- shared dignity,
- and shared responsibility for creating a calmer room.

Care
————
- If shared, keep the inside of the hood and bead tunnels clean and scent-free.
- Inspect seams and bead tunnels regularly for safety.
- If personally owned, a wearer may choose to anoint the beads lightly
  with a meaningful scent, as long as it does not disrupt others.

Closing Thought
——————
MythWear assumes that clothing can be a teacher, an ally, and a quiet form of architecture
for the nervous system. The Beaded Sanctuary Hood is one such teacher: a small, portable
cave that travels with the student, offering shelter without separation, and calm
without shame.
