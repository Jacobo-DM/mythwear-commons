<h2>MythWear Commons License (V2.0)</h2>

<p>
MythWear is an open-hardware, open-movement, open-story project.  
All designs, schematics, blueprints, symbols, patterns, writings, and prototypes shared under this license belong to the Commons — to be remixed, rebuilt, reimagined, and carried forward for the good of many.
</p>

<h3>1. Freedom to Study, Make, and Remix</h3>
<p>
You may read, study, adapt, modify, rebuild, repair, and evolve any MythWear design for personal, educational, communal, or cultural use.  
You may create derivative works, alternate versions, and entirely new branches in the MythWear lineage.
</p>

<h3>2. No Enclosures</h3>
<p>
No part of MythWear may be enclosed, locked behind paywalls, patented, trademarked, privatized, or restricted in ways that prevent others from learning, adapting, or continuing the work.  
Commercial profit is allowed <em>only</em> if the work remains open — meaning: all modified designs must remain freely accessible under this same license.
</p>

<h3>3. Responsibility and Safety</h3>
<p>
You are responsible for your own use, construction, and adaptations of MythWear artifacts.  
Share with care, build with integrity, and avoid harmful, extractive, or deceptive applications.  
MythWear must never be used to manipulate, surveil, or harm individuals or communities.
</p>

<h3>4. Attribution in the Flower Road Spirit</h3>
<p>
Please acknowledge the lineage by including:
<br />
“Built from MythWear Commons — shared in the spirit of the Flower Road.”
<br /><br />
Attribution is not a gatekeeping requirement. It is a gesture of gratitude.  
The goal is continuity, not control.
</p>

<h3>5. Community Repair, Local Knowledge</h3>
<p>
Where possible, use local materials, low-tech tools, and accessible methods.  
Teach others what you learn.  
Repair before replacing.  
Share improvements back to the Commons so others may walk the road with clarity.
</p>

<h3>6. No Extractive Institutions</h3>
<p>
This license explicitly forbids:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>corporate enclosure,</li>
  <li>surveillance technologies,</li>
  <li>behavior-modification systems,</li>
  <li>military or policing applications,</li>
  <li>platforms that exploit user data or attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>
MythWear is for healing, creativity, movement, learning, and human connection.
</p>

<h3>7. Perpetual Commons</h3>
<p>
This license is irrevocable.  
No future owner, entity, or platform may restrict the freedoms granted here.  
All descendants — direct or remixed — remain part of the MythWear Commons.
</p>

<h3>8. The Soft Clause (The Flower Road Clause)</h3>
<p>
If a future generation wishes to add, clarify, or refine this license, they may do so only if:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the work remains open and accessible to all,</li>
  <li>the intention remains healing, creative, and communal,</li>
  <li>the changes strengthen — not weaken — the Commons.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This clause honors living tradition rather than dead law.
</p>

<h3>9. The Blessing</h3>
<p>
May this work serve many hands.  
May it ignite movement and imagination.  
May it travel farther than we can.  
May it never be forgotten or enclosed.  
Walk with care. Walk with wonder. Walk the Flower Road.
</p>
