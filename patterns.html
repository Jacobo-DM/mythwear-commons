  <h1>MythWear Patterns · Wearable Archive</h1>

  <p>
    Text-only, body-worn blueprints released under the
    <a href="mythwear-license.html">MythWear Commons License v1.1</a>.<br>
    MythWear garments are <strong>body-centered</strong>: hoods, masks, bands,
    tabi, and leaf-circuits stitched into clothing — nothing that is not worn
    on the body.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Wearable Patterns</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="mythwear_hood_pattern.txt">MythWear Hood · Arc–Spine Pattern</a><br>
      A soft hood with spine-line channel and three anchor points at brow and temples,
      with a line over the crown and down the back.<br>
      <em>Includes optional “Beaded Sanctuary Module”: a quiet interior of wooden beads
      along the rim, crown, or spine-line — a portable cave for grounding, reflection,
      and classroom calm.</em>
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="rootmask_structure.txt">RootMask / RootFace · Nopal Lattice</a><br>
      A ventilated face frame inspired by cactus rib structures — breath-first design,
      soft light, open sight.
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="leaf_circuit_pattern.txt">Leaf Circuit · Wearable Nervous System</a><br>
      A stitched or painted map of flow — a body-based nervous system for grounding,
      movement, and return.
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="wrist_to_elbow_band.txt">Wrist–Elbow Band · Force Path Trainer</a><br>
      Dual soft cuffs linked by a band that teaches the path of force through the
      forearm — a training companion for RageDance, writing posture, and mindful play.
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="tabi_and_ankle_band.txt">Tabi + Ankle Band · Grounding Feet</a><br>
      Split-toe tabi with a gentle Achilles band — “listening shoes” for quiet steps,
      balance, and grounding.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Modules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="modules/beaded_sanctuary.txt">Beaded Sanctuary Module</a><br>
      Portable cave interior for hoods and garments — grounding beads along rim, crown,
      or spine. Can be added to MythWear Hood, RootMask side panels, Leaf Circuit spine
      lines, and more.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Guides</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="guides/teachers_notes_sanctuary_hood.txt">Teacher’s Notes: Beaded Sanctuary Hood</a><br>
      Classroom guide for trauma-aware, nonverbal regulation and calm. Explains how
      students can use the hood as a quiet signal: “I need a moment, but I am still here.”
    </li>
  </ul>
