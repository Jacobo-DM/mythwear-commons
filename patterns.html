# MythWear Patterns

Text-only, body-worn blueprints released under the
[MythWear Commons License v1.1](mythwear-license.html).  
MythWear garments are **body-centered**: hoods, masks, bands, tabi, and leaf-circuits
stitched into clothing — nothing that is not worn on the body.

## Core Wearable Patterns

- [MythWear Hood · Arc–Spine Pattern](mythwear_hood_pattern.txt)  
  A soft hood with spine-line channel and three anchor points.  
  _Includes optional “Beaded Sanctuary Module”: a quiet interior of wooden beads
  along the rim, crown, or spine-line — a portable cave for grounding, reflection,
  and classroom calm._

- [RootMask / RootFace · Nopal Lattice](rootmask_structure.txt)  
  A ventilated face frame inspired by cactus rib structures — breath-first
  design, soft light, open sight.

- [Leaf Circuit · Wearable Nervous System](leaf_circuit_pattern.txt)  
  A stitched or painted map of flow — a body-based nervous system for grounding
  and movement.

- [Wrist–Elbow Band · Force Path Trainer](wrist_to_elbow_band.txt)  
  Dual soft cuffs linked by a band that teaches the path of force through the
  forearm — a training companion for RageDance and mindful play.

- [Tabi + Ankle Band · Grounding Feet](tabi_and_ankle_band.txt)  
  Split-toe tabi with a gentle Achilles band — “listening shoes” for quiet
  steps, balance, and grounding.
## Modules

## Guides

- [Teacher’s Notes: Beaded Sanctuary Hood](guides/teachers_notes_sanctuary_hood.txt)  
  Classroom guide for trauma-aware, nonverbal regulation and calm. Explains how
  students can use the hood as a quiet signal: “I need a moment, but I am still here.”
