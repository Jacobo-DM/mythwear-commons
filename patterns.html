  <h1>MythWear Patterns</h1>

  <p>
    Text-only, body-worn blueprints released under the
    <a href="../">MythWear Commons License v1.1</a>.
    MythWear patterns are <strong>garments and wearable tools only</strong>:
    hoods, masks, bands, tabi, and leaf-circuits stitched into clothing —
    nothing that is not worn on the body.
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>
      <a href="mythwear_hood_pattern.txt">MythWear Hood · Arc–Spine Pattern</a><br>
      A soft hood that frames the face with three anchor points at brow and temples,
      and a spine-channel running over crown and down the back.
      <br><em>Includes optional “Beaded Sanctuary Module”: a quiet interior of wooden beads
      along the rim, crown, or spine-line — a portable cave for grounding, reflection,
      and classroom calm.</em>
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="rootmask_structure.txt">RootMask / RootFace · Nopal Lattice</a><br>
      A ventilated face frame inspired by cactus rib structures — breath-first design,
      soft light, open sight.
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="leaf_circuit_pattern.txt">Leaf Circuit · Wearable Nervous System</a><br>
      Subtle spine-and-branch lines stitched or corded onto garments to map attention,
      movement, and flow.
    </li>

    </li>
      <a href="wrist_to_elbow_band.txt">Wrist–Elbow Band · Force Path Trainer</a><br>
      Dual soft cuffs linked by a band that teaches the path of force through the forearm —
      a training companion for RageDance and mindful play.
    </li>

    <li>
      <a href="tabi_and_ankle_band.txt">Tabi + Ankle Band · Grounding Feet</a><br>
      Split-toe tabi with a gentle Achilles band — “listening shoes” for quiet steps,
      balance, and grounding.
    </li>

  </ul>
