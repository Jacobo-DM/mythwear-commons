Purpose
———
The Wrist–Elbow Band is a wearable training tool that teaches how force travels
through the arm — from the wrist to the elbow and into the shoulder. It enhances
awareness for RageDance, martial flow, writing posture, and any movement that
requires grounding, precision, or emotional regulation.

This is a somatic teacher disguised as a soft piece of clothing.

Design Principles
———————
- Two soft cuffs: one at the wrist, one at the upper forearm or elbow.
- A connecting band that is firm enough to give feedback, but soft enough to twist.
- No restriction of circulation anywhere.
- The band should feel like guidance, not restraint.

Materials
————
- Soft cotton or linen for cuffs.
- Velcro, snaps, or tie closures.
- Connecting band made of:
  - cotton tape,
  - flat elastic,
  - braided strap,
  - or soft leather.
- Optional: bead or knot nodes sewn along the connecting band to indicate “direction of force.”

Band Length
—————
Ideal length:  
**18–30 cm (7–12 inches)** depending on arm size.

The band should be long enough for full extension and bending, but short enough
to give light tension when the arm rotates.

Construction Steps
————————
1. **Make the Wrist Cuff**
   - Cut a strip of cotton or linen approx. 15–20 cm long.
   - Fold, stitch, and reinforce edges.
   - Add a closure (Velcro, tie, or button loop).
   - The cuff should fit snugly but comfortably.

2. **Make the Elbow/Forearm Cuff**
   - Same as wrist cuff, but slightly larger circumference.
   - Place it 5–10 cm below the elbow.

3. **Add the Connecting Band**
   - Stitch one end to the wrist cuff.
   - Stitch the other end to the forearm cuff.
   - Reinforce both attachments.

4. **Optional: Force Path Nodes**
   - Add 2–4 small wooden or cloth beads along the band.
   - The wearer can run fingers along them to sense direction:
     wrist → elbow → shoulder → spine.

How to Wear
—————
1. Place the wrist cuff just above the wrist bones.
2. Place the second cuff on the upper forearm, below the elbow.
3. Align the connecting band on the **outer** or **inner** arm depending on the practice.

Band Placements
———————
**Outer Arm (recommended for RageDance):**
- Supports the natural line of force in striking and pushing.
- Teaches clean lengthening of the arm.

**Inner Arm (recommended for writing and breathwork):**
- Supports awareness of breath channels and gentler movements.

Sensory Function
———————
The band gives three kinds of feedback:

1. **Tensional Feedback**  
   When the arm rotates or extends, slight tension guides the wearer to align
   from wrist → elbow → shoulder.

2. **Tactile Feedback**  
   The beads or stitched nodes provide a path the wearer can trace with their fingers.

3. **Directional Awareness**  
   Wearing the band over time builds instinctive understanding of:
   - where force is leaking,
   - where tension is unnecessary,
   - and how to return to one calm, aligned path.

Uses
————
- RageDance drills
- Martial movement and flow
- Writing posture and recovery (excellent for students and teachers)
- Grounding during anxiety or freeze states
- Relearning gentle arm extension after injury or overuse
- Classroom calm

Variations
————
- Double-band (wrist → elbow and elbow → shoulder)
- Glow-thread stitching for nighttime practice
- Two bands worn symmetrically for balanced training
- Integrated Leaf Circuit designs branching from the cuffs

Philosophy
—————
This band is a simple tool but a profound one.  
It teaches:
- alignment,
- economy of motion,
- emotional clarity,
- and the return to flow.

It is a companion for practice, for writing, and for the quiet rebuilding of one’s own strength.
