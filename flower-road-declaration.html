<h2>Flower Road &amp; Discovery Mode · Foundation Declaration (V2.0)</h2>

<p>
The Flower Road is a path, not a product.  
Discovery Mode is one way of walking that path together.
</p>

<p>
This declaration names our intentions so that others may understand, adapt, and carry them forward.  
It is not a contract. It is a compass.
</p>

<h3>1. Why the Flower Road Exists</h3>
<p>
We are living in a time of fracture, acceleration, and forgetting.  
Children are growing up inside systems that reward obedience to pace and metrics, while quietly eroding wonder, resilience, and relational trust.
</p>
<p>
The Flower Road exists to remember another way:
to learn in motion, in community, in relationship with land and place;  
to honor the body as an instrument of perception, not a problem to manage;  
to weave story, science, craft, and courage into daily practice.
</p>

<h3>2. What Discovery Mode Is</h3>
<p>
Discovery Mode is a rhythm and a frame for learning.  
It is a way of moving through the world that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>treats curiosity as a birthright,</li>
  <li>treats the body as an ally in thinking,</li>
  <li>treats land and water as teachers, not scenery,</li>
  <li>treats each person as a carrier of stories and skill.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It can take the form of walks, field days, movement sessions, quiet observation, shared making, or collective problem-solving.  
It is simple on purpose: so that anyone, anywhere, can adapt it with minimal tools and maximum care.
</p>

<h3>3. What Discovery Mode Is Not</h3>
<p>
Discovery Mode is not:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>a brand, franchise, or proprietary curriculum,</li>
  <li>a behavior-management system,</li>
  <li>a pipeline to standardized achievement,</li>
  <li>a means of surveillance, extraction, or data-harvesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>
No one may enclose Discovery Mode as private property, nor use its language or designs to sell obedience, manipulation, or false scarcity.
</p>

<h3>4. Core Commitments</h3>
<p>
Any practice carried under the name “Flower Road” or “Discovery Mode” honors these commitments:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Interbeing:</strong> We recognize that our lives are entangled with land, water, air, animal, plant, and each other.</li>
  <li><strong>Dignity:</strong> No child, elder, or participant is treated as disposable, data, or scenery.</li>
  <li><strong>Co-creation:</strong> We design <em>with</em> communities, not <em>for</em> them from afar.</li>
  <li><strong>Embodiment:</strong> Movement, breath, and sensation are respected as ways of knowing.</li>
  <li><strong>Commons:</strong> Designs, protocols, and stories shared under this name stay open and accessible, in the spirit of the MythWear Commons License.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Practices on the Road</h3>
<p>
Discovery Mode may include, but is not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>walking talks and listening walks,</li>
