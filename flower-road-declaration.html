    <h2>Flower Road &amp; Discovery Mode · Foundation Declaration (V2.0)</h2>

    <p>
      The Flower Road is a path, not a product.  
      Discovery Mode is one way of walking that path together.
    </p>

    <p>
      This declaration names our intentions so that others may understand, adapt, and carry them forward.  
      It is not a contract. It is a compass.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Why the Flower Road Exists</h3>
    <p>
      We are living in a time of fracture, acceleration, and forgetting.  
      Children are growing up inside systems that reward obedience to pace and metrics, while quietly eroding wonder, resilience, and relational trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Flower Road exists to remember another way:
      to learn in motion, in community, in relationship with land and place;  
      to honor the body as an instrument of perception, not a problem to manage;  
      to weave story, science, craft, and courage into daily practice.
    </p>

    <h3>2. What Discovery Mode Is</h3>
    <p>
      Discovery Mode is a rhythm and a frame for learning.  
      It is a way of moving through the world that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>treats curiosity as a birthright,</li>
      <li>treats the body as an ally in thinking,</li>
      <li>treats land and water as teachers, not scenery,</li>
      <li>treats each person as a carrier of stories and skill.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It can take the form of walks, field days, movement sessions, quiet observation, shared making, or collective problem-solving.  
      It is simple on purpose: so that anyone, anywhere, can adapt it with minimal tools and maximum care.
    </p>

    <h3>3. What Discovery Mode Is Not</h3>
    <p>
      Discovery Mode is not:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>a brand, franchise, or proprietary curriculum,</li>
      <li>a behavior-management system,</li>
      <li>a pipeline to standardized achievement,</li>
      <li>a means of surveillance, extraction, or data-harvesting.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No one may enclose Discovery Mode as private property, nor use its language or designs to sell obedience, manipulation, or false scarcity.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Core Commitments</h3>
    <p>
      Any practice carried under the name “Flower Road” or “Discovery Mode” honors these commitments:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interbeing:</strong> We recognize that our lives are entangled with land, water, air, animal, plant, and each other.</li>
      <li><strong>Dignity:</strong> No child, elder, or participant is treated as disposable, data, or scenery.</li>
      <li><strong>Co-creation:</strong> We design <em>with</em> communities, not <em>for</em> them from afar.</li>
      <li><strong>Embodiment:</strong> Movement, breath, and sensation are respected as ways of knowing.</li>
      <li><strong>Commons:</strong> Designs, protocols, and stories shared under this name stay open and accessible, in the spirit of the MythWear Commons License.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Practices on the Road</h3>
    <p>
      Discovery Mode may include, but is not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>walking talks and listening walks,</li>
      <li>Rage Dance and other movement practices that transmute anger into presence and care,</li>
      <li>field kits, simple tools, and low-tech prototypes that sharpen attention,</li>
      <li>story circles, journaling, and creative response,</li>
      <li>acts of tending: cleaning, restoring, planting, mending.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each practice is an invitation, not an obligation.  
      Local culture, language, and ecology come first.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Boundaries and Protections</h3>
    <p>
      To protect the integrity of this work:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Flower Road and Discovery Mode may not be used to justify militarized, carceral, or extractive programs.</li>
      <li>They may not be used to decorate harmful institutions without real change in practice.</li>
      <li>Any use of recordings, images, or data from participants must be transparent, consent-based, and minimal.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When in doubt, we choose the option that safeguards the most vulnerable people and places involved.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Sharing and Adaptation</h3>
    <p>
      You are encouraged to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>adapt these ideas for your own community,</li>
      <li>translate them into other languages,</li>
      <li>simplify them for children,</li>
      <li>expand them with local stories, songs, and practices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When you do, we ask that you acknowledge the lineage with a simple gesture such as:
      <br /><br />
      “Inspired by the Flower Road and Discovery Mode Commons.”
      <br /><br />
      This is not a legal demand. It is a way of keeping the thread visible.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Living Document</h3>
    <p>
      This declaration is a living document.  
      Future practitioners may refine, clarify, or extend it if — and only if — the changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>deepen the commitment to the Commons,</li>
      <li>strengthen protections for people and place,</li>
      <li>remain aligned with the spirit of interbeing and mutual care.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not worship the text. We serve the relationships it points to.
    </p>

    <h3>9. A Small Blessing for the Road</h3>
    <p>
      May these words be light enough to travel and strong enough to hold.  
      May they help teachers, parents, guardians, artists, and wanderers remember that another way of learning is not only possible, but already here, in the small brave acts of everyday care.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are holding this declaration, you are already part of the story.  
      Walk gently. Listen deeply.  
      Welcome to the Flower Road.
